Potato Leaf Disease Detection
Overview
This project utilizes machine learning and deep learning techniques to detect and classify diseases in potato leaves. By analyzing leaf images, the system identifies common diseases such as blight, mosaic, and yellowing. The tool helps in early disease detection, improving crop management and yield predictions.

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for model development and deployment.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Libraries for data visualization, including plotting training results.
PyTorch & TensorFlow: Deep learning frameworks for building and training models.
Keras: High-level neural networks API for easy model building.
Jupyter: Interactive notebook used for data exploration and model training.
Streamlit: Framework for building interactive web applications to showcase the model.
Features
Classifies diseases in potato leaves using image-based machine learning models.
Visualizes data and model performance using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Allows user-friendly, real-time disease prediction via a Streamlit interface.
Supports both TensorFlow and PyTorch models for flexibility in model training.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/potato-leaf-disease-detection.git
cd potato-leaf-disease-detection
Install dependencies:

Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies listed in requirements.txt:

bash
